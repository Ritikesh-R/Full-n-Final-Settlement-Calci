    <h1>What is the Full and final settlement?</h1>
    <p>Full and final settlement, commonly known as the F&F settlement is a process followed by 
        organizations to settle all the outstanding dues with an employee who is leaving the organization 
        for the following reasons -
    </p>


    <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
    <li>Resignation</li></br>
    <li>Retirement</li></br>
    <li>Termination</li>
    </div>

    <p>The full and final settlement process involves calculating and paying the employee's 
        last month's salary, tax deductions, bonus earnings, unused leaves, and any other 
        outstanding dues such as reimbursements, gratuity, and provident fund.
    </p>

    <p>This settlement becomes crucial to ensure that both the employee and the employer 
        settle all the outstanding financial obligations to each other before parting ways. 
        It helps maintain a healthy relationship between the employer and the employee and 
        avoids any legal disputes that may arise in the future.
    </p>

    <div>
        <h1>The full and final settlement process</h1>

        <p>A full and final settlement process can be time-consuming. However, 
           these are the basic steps followed by any organization. Please note that the 
           following steps can change according to the company policy.

                Full and final settlement calculation - what are the components involved?
            </h1>

            <p>
                The Full and Final Settlement calculation can be tedious with a lot of components 
                involved for calculation. The net payable full and final settlement amount is calculated 
                based on inclusions, which are basically the earnings and deductions, which are deducted 
                from the earnings mentioned.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let us have a look at the major components involved in the full and final 
                settlement calculation.
            </p>

            <h3>Inclusions</h3>
            <div style="margin-left: 30px;">
                <li>Unpaid salary</li></br>
                <li>Bonus</li></br>
                <li>Leave Enchasement</li></br>
                <li>Reimbursements</li>
            </div>

            <h3>Unpaid salary</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Unpaid salary is the salary that an employee has earned for the days worked 
                    between the date of resignation and the last working day.
                </p>

                <p>In other cases, the full and final settlement is calculated based on how the 
                    employees are paid during the notice period.
                </p>

                <p>For instance, if an employee serves a notice period of 2 months, the organization 
                    can pay the employee his/her salary for 1 month and use the full and final settlement 
                    for the next month. Or, the company can use the full and final settlement for the 
                    entire 2-month notice period.
                </p>

                <p>This includes any pending salaries for the previous months. Additionally, 
                    any other outstanding payments like arrears and Leave Travel Allowance (LTA) 
                    are also included in the unpaid salary calculation.

                These must be encashed and added to the full and final settlement of the employee.
            </p>

            <p>According to regulations, all dues from unpaid leaves must be paid to the employee on 
                or before the 7th and 10th of the following month.

        <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>
        Earned leaves and leaves offered in the employee’s contract can also be considered non-availed leaves if unused.
        </p>

        <p>Organizations typically encash unpaid leaves in two ways, they leave encashment based on 
            per day’s basic salary and a pre-defined fixed amount (decided by the organization).
        </p>

        </div>

        <h1>Fixed Amount Defined by the Company</h1>
        <p>The company may choose to fix an amount that can be encashed against a paid leave, 
            which is not dependent on the employee's salary directly.
        </p>

        <h3>Deductions</h3>
        <p>Deductions refer to the various payments that are deducted from an employee's 
           final dues, this includes
        </p>

        <p>1. Income tax deductions</p>
        <p>2. Provident fund deductions</p>
        <p>3. Professional taxes (if applicable) deductions, and</p>
        <p>4. Compensation for the unserved notice period.</p>
        <p>5. Gratuity</p>
        <p>6. Pension</p>

        <h3>Income tax deductions</h3>

        <p>The exact deductions vary based on factors such as the employee's income, in-hand salary, 
            and organization, among others. Provident fund and professional taxes are typically based 
            on the employee's income, while income tax deductions depend on their income bracket.
        </p>

        <p>The TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) deductions are exempted for encashed leaves and gratuity, 
            as per the Income Tax Act.
        </p>

        <p>In India, employers earning up to 2.5 LPA are exempted from income tax. However, 
           employees earning between 2.5-5 LPA are subject to TDS deductions of 5%, and so on.
        </p>

        <h1 style="margin-top: 50px;">Gratuity</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                Gratuity must be paid within 30 days of the employee's separation from the company. 
                If not paid within the stipulated time, the company may have to pay gratuity with interest.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gratuity is a cash benefit that employers provide to employees who have completed a minimum 
                of 4 years or 240 days of service.

    <h1>Pension</h1>

    <p>When an employee completes 10 years of "pensionable service" (minimum) with the organization 
        are eligible for pensions.
    </p>

    <p>A "Scheme certificate" is provided after retirement or upon reaching 58 years of age to 
       avail the pensions. Most employees receive a pension as part of the E.P.S. (Employee Pension Scheme), 
       which specifies a minimum pension amount of Rs 1000, which is around Rs 7500.
    </p>

    <p>As per Segment 72(5) of the E.P.F Act 1952, businesses must submit the E.P.F (Employer’s Provident Fund) 
        guarantee forms within 5 days of the employee's claim.
